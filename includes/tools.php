                <h3 class="title">Mobile First</h3>
            </section>
            <p>The “mobile first” concept implies a website is designed for optimal use and fast load times on smart phones – where most web traffic originates. When the site is viewed on larger screens, additional styling and functionality contribute to the user’s experience (progressive enhancement). Google actualluy downgrades search rankings (SEO) when a site isn’t properly mobile optimized.</p>

            <section class="heading">
                <div class="fai"><i class="fab fa-wordpress-simple"></i></div>
                <h3 class="title">WordPress</h3>
            </section>
            <p>Use the right platform for your site. A mobile first site will work if you only need a few images, an about section, and social media links. WordPress is used for more robust sites with galleries, forms, a shop, etc. WordPress is FREE, and is the most popular and user-friendly content management system (CMS) on the web. Its dashboard makes it a snap to create, update and/or edit content.</p>

                <h3 class="title">CSS Grid</h3>
            </section>
            <p>CSS Grid is a powerful tool for creating flexible, responsive web layouts in both vertical and horizontal directions (surprisingly, a new-ish concept in web design). This amazingly versitle system streamlines the design process by reducing specificity when styling individual elements and it maintains the content's underlying semantics. Resize your browser to see it in action!</p>

                <h3 class="title">Usability</h3>
            </section>
            <p>One of the most important – and often overlooked – concepts in web design is thinking about the site’s visitors. Is the focus of the site clear? And is the site user-friendly? There are actually measurable usability factors too. Providing your visitors with a quality experience (coupled with style and functionality) will bring them back again.</p>
