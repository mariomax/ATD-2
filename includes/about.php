    <h3>Mobile First</h3>
    <p>The “mobile first” method implies a website is designed for optimal results on smart phones – where most web traffic originates. When the site’s viewed on larger screens, additional styling and functionality contribute to the user’s experience (progressive enhancement). Google downgrades search rankings (SEO) if a site isn’t mobile optimized! This isn’t the end-all goal of web design though – users spend more time at sites when visited from “desktop” machines.</p>

    <h3>WordPress</h3>
    <p>Get the right platform for your content. A lightweight, mobile first site may suffice if you only need a few images, an about section, and social media links. WordPress could be used for more robust sites with galleries, forms, a shop, etc. WordPress is the most popular and user-friendly content management system (CMS) on the web. Its dashboard makes it a snap to update and/or edit content. Either way, we can put your site together with custom graphics and photography – all from one studio.</p>

    <h3>Usability</h3>
    <p>Finally, one of the most important – and often overlooked – concepts in web design is thinking about a site’s visitors. Is the focus of the site clear? And is the site user-friendly? There are measurable usability factors too. Hopefully, providing your visitors with a quality experience (coupled with style and functionality) will bring them back again.</p>
