			<p>A site built with custom graphics &amp; photography will enhance the uniqueness of your brand.<br />
			<em>[that's the plan]</em></p>
			<p>A site designed with your business' customers in mind draws traffic.<br />
			<em>[that's the goal]</em></p>
			<p>For years I studied and worked in “applied art” - photography, graphic and print design, screen printing, etc. This became the foundation for my transition into web design.
